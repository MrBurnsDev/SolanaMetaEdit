Replit Prompt ‚Äî Stabilize V2 Metadata Editor (Production-Ready)

You must stop applying temporary workarounds and stabilize the existing V2 platform so it works as production-ready software.

üéØ Core Fixes Required
	1.	Viewing Must Always Work
	‚Ä¢	Any user should be able to view an NFT or collection by mint address.
	‚Ä¢	Remove all blockers or debug gates (e.g. ‚Äúauthority check failed‚Äù banners that stop the page).
	‚Ä¢	Metadata and attributes must always load, even without a connected wallet.
	2.	Authority Check Placement
	‚Ä¢	Only enforce authority verification when a user tries to save metadata changes.
	‚Ä¢	Implement a small Authority Checker box above the forms:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Green if the connected wallet matches updateAuthority.
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow if not.
	‚Ä¢	This checker is informational until the user clicks Save/Update Metadata.
	‚Ä¢	If user lacks authority ‚Üí block save and show error toast.
	‚Ä¢	If user has authority ‚Üí allow transaction build + submit.
	3.	RPC Configuration
	‚Ä¢	Force all blockchain reads and writes through Alchemy RPC (NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_MAINNET_URL).
	‚Ä¢	Do not fall back to Helius or public endpoints unless explicitly configured.
	‚Ä¢	DAS/asset fetches must also go through Alchemy if possible.
	‚Ä¢	Remove any leftover ‚Äúfallback storage‚Äù or fake authority checks.
	4.	Transaction Builder
	‚Ä¢	All NFT + collection updates must use updateV1 via UMI.
	‚Ä¢	Eliminate any deprecated instructions (createUpdateMetadataAccountV2Instruction etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Ensure creators[i].verified = false to avoid multi-signer requirements.
	5.	UI Unification
	‚Ä¢	The same editor form should be used for:
	‚Ä¢	Single NFT editing
	‚Ä¢	Collection-wide editing
	‚Ä¢	Shared fields (royalties, creators, symbol, description) should display consistently.
	‚Ä¢	NFT-specific attributes should still be visible in single-NFT mode.
	‚Ä¢	In batch mode: show placeholders for traits that would be overridden (e.g. ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è This will overwrite individual attributes‚Äù).
	6.	Remove Non-Essentials
	‚Ä¢	Delete all SPL Token editing code, test panels, smoke tests, and memo-test files.
	‚Ä¢	Only retain code for:
	‚Ä¢	Single NFT editing
	‚Ä¢	Collection-wide editing
	‚Ä¢	Authority checks
	‚Ä¢	Transaction history
	7.	Acceptance Tests (Must Pass)
	‚Ä¢	Load mint 3NF7v8NecF8AJAHs1HFjqxQpEdLpNpXutc9vRyY9yhGU. Metadata must display immediately without wallet.
	‚Ä¢	Connect Phantom with authority wallet ‚Üí ‚úÖ green checker. Try save ‚Üí transaction must send.
	‚Ä¢	Connect Phantom with non-authority wallet ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è yellow checker. Try save ‚Üí blocked with toast.
	‚Ä¢	Edit collection royalties ‚Üí must succeed if authority wallet connected.
	‚Ä¢	Emergency royalties toggle (100% royalties) must be visible in collection editor and functional.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not add new features until this stabilization is done.
The goal of this prompt is to:
	‚Ä¢	Remove blockers.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure RPC connectivity.
	‚Ä¢	Fix authority checks at the correct layer.
	‚Ä¢	Deliver a production-ready MVP that edits metadata.
